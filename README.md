# Distributed finetuning
This repository is meant for finetuning large language models (of any scale) using multiple backends. The following backends are currently supported:

1. [DeepSpeed](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed)
2. [FSDP](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/fsdp.html)

The repository currently only supports generative models but can be easily extended to non-generative models if needed. 2 main class of models from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) are supported:

1. decoder models like GPT2, OPT, BLOOM etc
1. encoder-decoder models like T5, BART etc

Please note that this repository doesn't support Tensor Parallel or Pipeline Parallel (yet ;p).

The repository supports models of any scale. But, I don't recommend training models larger than 20 Billion using this repository as using ZeRO-DP is not the most efficient method of scaling to hyper-large models.

# Usage

Please note that the training scripts need to be launched on all nodes parallely for multinode training. For training and inference, take a look at [scripts](scripts/) to train on sst2.

### Training on CCC
For example, for using 2 nodes with 4 GPUs each (8 GPUs) on CCC, it can be done using:
```shell
jbsub -q x86_24h -cores 2x8+4 -mem 128G -require a100_80gb -err err.log -out out.log blaunch.sh sh scripts/train_ccc.sh
```
Note that the `blaunch.sh` script here (provided by CCC) executes the command `sh scripts/train_ccc.sh` on both the nodes.

### Training on Vela cluster
```shell
helm template -f scripts/train_vela.yaml chart | tee appwrapper.yaml | oc create -f -
```

## Supported optimizers
```python
# https://nvidia.github.io/apex/optimizers.html
from apex.optimizers import FusedAdam as ApexFusedAdam
from apex.optimizers import FusedLAMB as ApexFusedLAMB

from torch.optim.sgd import SGD as TorchSGD
```

## Dataset
The data directory should obey the following structure:
```text
ðŸ“¦data
 â”£ ðŸ“‚train
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œfilename1.jsonl
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œfilename2.jsonl
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œfilename3.jsonl
 â”— ðŸ“‚val
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œfilename1.jsonl
 â”£ ðŸ“‚test
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œfilename1.jsonl
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œfilename2.jsonl
```
Filenames can be anything as long as there are no whitespaces in them. Each line in each file should be a json (jsonlines file format) with the entries looking like:
```json
{"input": "The movie sucks", "output": "negative"}
{"input": "The movie was awesome", "output": "positive"}
```
Note for the test set, only `"input"` field is needed in the json instances in each line. `"output"` field is not needed. \
All the files in each directory are concatenated to form the respective split. \
If you need reformatting of the examples, you can use `--input_format` and `--output_format` arguments. For example `--input_format = 'Classify the sentiment of the sentence:\n__input__\nSentiment:'` and `--output_format = ' __output__'` reformats the input and output examples to:
```text
INPUT:
Classify the sentiment of the sentence:
The movie sucks
Sentiment:

OUTPUT:
 negative
```
If you don't need any reformatting, leave the arguments `--input_format` and `--output_format` to their default values `__input__` and `__output__` respectively. \
Please note that the user is expected to provide this at both training and inference time. \
Try not to have trailing spaces in `input_format`, if you need a space between input and output, the space should be part of the `output_format`.

# Tracking experiments
The repository also supports [aim](https://github.com/aimhubio/aim) and [wandb](https://wandb.ai/) based experiment tracking. For viewing the aim dashboard, simply run
```shell
aim up --host <HOST_ADDRESS> --port <HOST_PORT> --repo <PATH_TO_AIM_REPO>
```
This brings up an awesome UI like this:

# HuggingFace compatible custom models

## Best training efficiency
To get best training efficiency, we use [padding free transformers](https://huggingface.co/blog/mayank-mishra/padding-free-transformer). This however, doesn't work for inference and you will need to load the model again without padding free transformers.

```python
import torch
from ibm_models import GPTMegatronForCausalLM


# we need unpadded lists here for avoiding any useless computations on pad tokens
input_ids = [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 0], [6, 7, 8, 0]]
labels = [[-100, -100, -100, 4, 5, 0], [-100, -100, 8, 0]]

# this will throw a warning saying that the model is of gpt_bigcode class
# ignore the warning
model = GPTMegatronForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "bigcode/starcoder",
    attn_implementation="flash_attention_2"
    use_padding_free_transformer=True,
).cuda()

loss = model(
    input_ids=input_ids,
    labels=labels,
).loss
```
